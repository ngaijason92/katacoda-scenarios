### The right to be informed & The right to object

The consent management also satisfies the right of the customers granted by the GDPR namely the right to be informed & the right to object.

The right to be informed:

Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data. The cookies notify the users that their data is collected. 

The right to object:

This also gives them the right to object where customers can always object to their data being used for any purpose by not giving their consent and reject the cookies. 

Therefore, the cookies which is the consent manager would help to satisfy the consent management required by the GDPR and the right to be informed & the right to object of the customers.
