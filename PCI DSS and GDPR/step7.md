# To be GDPR compliant

## The right to access and the right to data portability
Right to access means that an EU resident has a right to a copy of all the data you’ve collected about him or her.

Right to data portability implies that any business that collects data must also offer the ability to for the user to download it and take/transfer the data elsewhere.

In the left column find "Tools", under "Tools" press "Export Personal Data" and start by confirming the identity of the person making the request before you touch their personal data. 

Then, under "Username or email address",  you can send a confirmation request to the customer’s email address. Type the email and press "Send Request".

The customer will then receive an email with a confirmation link, which they’ll use to confirm the request.

While you’re waiting for the customer to confirm, you’ll see the request displayed as “Pending.” Once they click the link, the status switches to “Confirmed”.

After the the status switches to “Confirmed”, you can then send the customer a link to the file or download their file yourself by clicking the button under "Next Steps" or under the requester field. 

After you’ve downloaded or emailed the file, the request will be marked “Completed.”

The customers then successfully access their data and can download it to take/transfer the data elsewhere.

This satisfies "the right to access" and "the right to data portability" of the customers.

## The right to rectification
The right to rectification means the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.

In the left column find "Users", under "Users" press "All users". Find the customers that demand amendments from the list or search it in the searchbar on top right corner. 

Press the name of the customers. Change the content according to their request. 

Scroll down and press "Update user".

Then the information of the users will be updated. 

This satisfies "The right to rectification" of the customers.


## The right to erasure or right to be forgotten
Right to erasure means that the customers have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay.

In the left column find "Tools", under "Tools" press "Erase Personal Data" and start by confirming the identity of the person making the request before you touch their personal data. 

Then, under "Username or email address",  you can send a confirmation request to the customer’s email address. Type the email and press "Send Request".

The customer will then receive an email with a confirmation link, which they’ll use to confirm the request.

While you’re waiting for the customer to confirm, you’ll see the request displayed as “Pending.” Once they click the link, the status switches to “Confirmed”.

After the the status switches to “Confirmed”, you can click the "Erase Personal Data" under "Next Steps" or under the requester field. Then, the software will start scrubbing away.

If a plugin needs to retain a bit of personal data for whatever reason, it will be displayed to you at the end of the erasure process. For further erasure, You may need to manually remove personal data collected by other plugins or services to be in full compliance with the Right to Erasure request. 

This satisfies "The right to erasure" of the customers.

## The right to restriction of processing
The right to restriction of processing means that an individual can limit the way that an organisation uses their data.

If one of the following applies:
1. the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;

2. the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;

3. the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

4. the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.

Upon request from the customers, the personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

This satisfies "The right to restriction of processing" of the customers.

## The right to object
The right to object gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data at any time.

Apart from cookies as the consent manager, upon request from the customers, the controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

This satisfies "The right to object" of the customers.

## The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing
The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing means the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.

Unless the data subject, 

1. is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;

2. is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests;

3. is based on the data subject’s explicit consent.

Upon request from the customers, the customer has one month to request for you to review the decision, or take a new decision not based solely on automated means. You must consider the request including any information provided by the individual. You need to respond to the individual within one month of receipt of their request and outline the steps you have taken as well as the outcome.

This satisfies "The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing" of the customers.
