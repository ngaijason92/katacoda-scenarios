# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

## What is GDPR?
The GDPR is a new law that concerns itself with the handling of personal data of European Union (EU) residents. 

The GDPR is intended to give EU residents more visibility and control over their personal data: how websites, including eCommerce websites, collect data; who they share it with; and what tracking technologies monitor them across the Internet. 

If you sell to EU residents, this law applies to you — even if you aren’t in the EU. Fines for non-compliance will be substantial and can be levied on businesses both in and outside the EU.

## To the store
GDPR requires stores to inform their customers about what information they collect, store, and share, and establishes specific rules about the kind of consent required before stores can collect personal data. That means that stores will be asking for consent more explicitly, and detailing their use of personal data more specifically in their privacy policies.

## To the EU residents
EU residents have rights granted by the GDPR, namely: 

The right to be informed        

The right to access

The right to rectification

The right to erasure or right to be forgotten

The right to restriction of processing

The right to data portability

The right to object

The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing

The GDPR also gives EU residents the right to find out if their personal data has been compromised. Stores will need to notify customers if their personal data is stolen in a breach, and do so in a timely manner.

## What data is protected? 
GDPR isn’t about all information—the new rights for EU residents specifically apply to Personal Data.

Personal Data means anything that can identify a person, either on its own or combined with other data. Examples include a person’s:

1. Name 
2. Physical address or email address
3. Phone number
4. Last four credit card digits
5. Shipping tracking numbers 
6. IP address

## What needed to be done?
Put Someone in charge of data.
