# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 

## What is GDPR?
The GDPR is a new law that concerns itself with the handling of personal data of European Union (EU) residents. 

The GDPR is intended to give EU residents more visibility and control over their personal data: how websites, including eCommerce websites, collect data; who they share it with; and what tracking technologies monitor them across the Internet. 

If you sell to EU residents, this law applies to you — even if you aren’t in the EU.  All companies and organisations that deal with data relating to EU citizens must comply by the new GDPR. Fines for non-compliance will be substantial and can be levied on businesses both in and outside the EU.

## Why GDPR?
The purpose of the GDPR is to provide a set of standardised data protection laws across all the member countries. This should make it easier for EU citizens to understand how their data is being used, and also raise any complaints, even if they are not in the country where its located. It is important because it improves the protection of European data subjects' rights and clarifies what companies that process personal data must do to safeguard these rights.

## To the store
GDPR requires stores to inform their customers about what information they collect, store, and share, and establishes specific rules about the kind of consent required before stores can collect personal data. That means that stores will be asking for consent more explicitly, and detailing their use of personal data more specifically in their privacy policies.

## To the EU residents
EU residents have rights granted by the GDPR, namely: 

1. The right to be informed        

2. The right to access

3. The right to rectification

4. The right to erasure or right to be forgotten

5. The right to restriction of processing

6. The right to data portability

7. The right to object

8. The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing

The GDPR also gives EU residents the right to find out if their personal data has been compromised. Stores will need to notify customers if their personal data is stolen in a breach, and do so in a timely manner.

## What data is protected? 
GDPR isn’t about all information—the new rights for EU residents specifically apply to Personal Data.

Personal Data means anything that can identify a person, either on its own or combined with other data. Examples include a person’s:

1. Name 
2. Physical address or email address
3. Phone number
4. Last four credit card digits
5. Shipping tracking numbers 
6. IP address

## What needed to be done to be GDPR compliant?
Put Someone in charge of data. Build a Privacy Policy, handle Consent Management and provide support to fulfill the rights that are granted to the users by GDPR.
